# Auto-w-Scrape
### An automated web scraper

*Web scraping is a technique to extract information from websites by using software programs to automate the process. These programs usually make HTTP requests directly from the code or simulate human behavior by embedding a browser inside the application.*

It is a python-based crawler build with the help of numerous scraping tools like **Selenium Webdriver**, **BeautifulSoup**, and many more. It is a programmed system that replicates the process various times to obtain data from given data retrieval nodes through the map path in the Depth-first search manner. **And, it applies to both Chrome and Firefox browsers in _Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS_.**

After the program is running, you have to form a flow chart structure on the frame that is a replicated procedure of the data retrieval, add a list of URLs to it, and provide a storage area (such as excel file or database) for storing data.

> ***Note:*** A node following a node means the next step in the process, while two sibling nodes have two perform two different procedures on the same point.
